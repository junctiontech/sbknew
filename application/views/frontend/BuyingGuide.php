									Book the Cheapest Flight Possible to Anywhere								
								</a>							
							</h4>
						</div>	
						<div id="collapseOne-2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
							<div class="panel-body">								
								<p>We’ve all experienced the tiresome, repeated searching when trying to book the cheapest possible flights to any given destination. With endless search engines and continually fluctuating prices, the approach to frugal flight booking is overwhelming. Here’s some key tips that will save you time, frustration and most importantly money when booking your next flight.</p><br>								
								
								<p> <b>1. Keep your searches top secret</b></p><br>
								
								<p>You’re not crazy for thinking that a flight price has changed after searching it a few times in your web browser. Based on the cookies in your browser, flight prices do increase when a particular route is repeatedly searched, as the site wants to scare you into booking the flight quickly before prices get even higher. Always search for flights in incognito or private browsing mode to see the lowest prices.</p><br>								
								
								<p>In Google Chrome or Safari, incognito is enabled by hitting Command (or “Control” if using PC), Shift, “N”. For Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer, hit Command (or “Control” if using a PC), Shift, “P”. This will open a new browser window where your information is not tracked, thus not inflating prices as you search. Note: if you’re using an older version of OS X, open Safari then click “Safari” in the menu bar, and select “Private Browsing”.</p><br>								
								<p>Your cookies are reset each time you re-open an incognito window. So if you want to start with a clean slate for each flight search (so your previous searches aren’t “remembered”, potentially inflating costs), close all your incognito windows, open a new one, and then perform your flight search.</p><br>								
								<p><b>2. Use the best flight search engines</b></p><br>	
								
								<p>All search engines have inflated flight costs as part of taking a cut from the airlines. Some search engines consistently inflate much higher than others. It pays to familiarise yourself with sites that offer the best prices.</p><br>
								
								<p><b>3. Identify the cheapest day to fly out</b></p><br>
								
								<p>While many theories exist around booking specifically on a Tuesday to save money, the reality is there is no consistent truth to exactly which days are cheapest to fly. Most of the time it is cheaper to leave on a weekday, though this isn't always the case. Your best strategy is to get a quick visual of prices for a whole month to see what days are cheapest for your specific route.</p><br>
								
								<p>Here’s how:</p><br>
								
								<p>Step 1. Hop on Searchb4kharch<br>
									Step 2. Enter your departure & arrival cities<br>
									Step 3. Select “one-way” (even if flying round trip – you’re just determining the cheapest days to fly out first)<br>
									Step 4. Click “Depart” but instead of entering a date, select “Whole Month” so you can see which date is cheapest<br>
									Step 5. Hit “search” and see which date is cheapest. Sometimes not all dates have a price listed, as indicated by the magnifying glasses. If you want to see a price that isn't shown, simply click on the magnifying glass over the date.</p><br>
								
								<p><b>4. If you know when and where you’re going, don’t wait to book</b></p>
								
								<p>Rarely ever do airline tickets get cheaper as your departure date approaches, especially if you need to fly on a certain date. Budget airlines typically offer low rates as a baseline price, and as these tickets sell, the remaining ones increase in cost. This is very typical in Europe and Australia. If you know when and where you’re going, don’t wait on an unknown sale. More often than not, your biggest savings come from booking far ahead when you can.</p><br>
								<p><b>5. Check if it’s cheaper to pay in other currencies</b></p>
								
								<p>Before booking a flight, consider if the rate is cheaper if paid in another currency. An important note when doing this: make sure you’re using a credit card that is free of foreign-transaction fees.</p><br>

									Save Money on Hotels

								<ul class="marker"> 									
									<li>Start your hotel search as early as you can. The longer stretch of time you have to search the better deal you’ll likely find. Hotel rates almost never go down for holiday destinations and resorts.</li>	
									
									<li>   Booking early isn't only about great deals. Early bookers get the best rooms.</li>  
									
									<li>  If your dates can be flexible then compare different date ranges for the best rates. Hotels can fill up for a big convention or big event. Busy and expensive one weekend. Empty and cheap the next.</li>  
									
									<li> Flip-flop weekends and weekdays. Hotels target different types of travellers which will have very different weekday and weekend routines. Hotels that have a large business clientèle can be very quiet (with large discounts) on weekends. Hotels that see more leisure tourists will be packed on weekends but cheaper on weekdays.</li>
									
									<li>  Think upgrade: book the least expensive room through a booking website then contact the hotel directly to inform them of special requirements or enquire about any available upgrades – if the hotel is quiet they’ll often be free or for a nominal charge.</li>							
								
								</ul>								
								
								<p><b>When is the Best Time to Book Hotels?</b></p>
								
								<p>Here’s a huge generalization that works pretty well for most situations: For hotels that have a business clientèle last minute booking can offer good deals. For hotels, resorts, and vacation rentals that have tourists as their primary guests then booking 3 months to 6 months prior to your stay is likely the best.</p><br>
								
								<p>Why? Business travellers are much more likely to arrange and make last-minute (or last week) travel plans. A month before a given date, a hotel in the financial district of London might not have many bookings but will not start discounting those rooms yet. It will still expect to make a lot of bookings in the week or two before that time frame.</p><br>
								
								<p>Often it’s not just about the price. Early booking will get you the best rooms at a similar price to the less coveted rooms. E.g. A huge family room that is only a little more than a cramped double room.</p><br>
								
								<p><b>What Day of the Week Has the Best Hotel Deals?</b></p>
								
								<p>It depends what type of hotel you’re booking.</p><br>
								
								<p>Business hotels will offer bigger discounts on the weekends (when business clients are at home). Budget hotels will have empty rooms (and discounts) through the week because the people that stay there (weekend shoppers, concert goers, university students) come on there weekends and return home Sunday night.</p><br>
								
								<p>A final tip, is to check whether breakfast is included. When you arrive at the hotel you can even ask (with a tone of voice that expects that it is included). It’s often of little cost to the hotel to serve another buffet breakfast but this can be a huge savings for you especially over the course of a week or extended stay.</p><br>

												<p><b>A tablet for all..</b></p>
												<p>Finding a tablet is never a easy task when there are so many options available in the
													market. A tablet is a portable computer that operates from a touchscreen or with a
													stylus. Some tablets even have a keyboard which makes it even more comfortable to
													use. They are normally smaller and lighter in weight than an average laptop. They are
													very helpful during travelling as they are very handy and convenient to use. Just like
													laptops and mobiles, tablets also comes with Windows browser and pre-installed
													applications. Tablets also have in-built battery having battery life of average 10-13
													hours or more , depending on its version. All new models have Wi-fi, GPS connectivity
													and webcam attached to it. Lot of great models of various reputed manufacturers are
													available in the market but it is difficult to choose.</p><br>									
									
												<p>Following are the points which will help you in deciding which tablet to buy:</p><br>							
												
												<ul class="marker2">
													<li>Operating System : Most important factor in buying a tablet depends on the
														operating system you want to go for. Tablets operability is determined by its
														operating system. There are three types of operating system- Apple iOS,Android OS and Windows 8 operating 
														system. Apple iPads are very easy-to-use
														tablets with smooth experience but are costlier than other tablets. Nowadays,
														iPad mini is also available which is cheaper option. Android OS tablets are easy
														to use and they are free, hence lot of options are available from branded as well
														Chinese manufacturers. The latest Android operating system being used these
														days is version 5, also called Lollipop. But some Android models are using									
														earlier versions like 4.2.</li>
													
													<li>Size of Tablet: Tablet comes in various screen sizes. Usually the screen size
														varies from 6 to 12 inches diagonally across the screen. The small sized tablets
														have screen size of 6 to 8 inches and are usually cheaper and require less
														power than larger tablets. If you are looking for light-weight, portable tablet
														which can fit easily in purse or small handbag, then probably 6-7 inches tablet is
														best suited. iPad has 8 inch screen. Medium sized tablets (with size 8.9 to 10.1
														inches) have better screen resolution and larger screens than 7-inch tablets.
														They are best suited for watching movies and doing office work. Very few
														tablets have screen size more than 10.1 inch (they are also called hybrids) and
														serve the purpose somewhere between tablet and PC.</li>
										
													<li>Storage : Tablets require storage space for all purposes, whether it is for storing
														games, movies or any text document. Minimum storage space available is 8 GB.
														As and when storage capacity increses, price also increases . Additional microSD
														slot is available in almost all tablets except in iPad and can be expanded further
														as well.</li>
									
												</ul>
									
									
												<p>If you want to work on the tablet, then opt for Windows8 tablet as it is more
user-friendly. For typing and watching movies, choose lighter and portable small-sizedtablets. We have vast collection of tablets of all popular and reputed brands like Acer,Sony, Dell, Apple, Lenovo, HP, HCl, Samsung, Toshiba, Asus, Micromax, Karbonn, to	name a few.</p>	<br>

												<p><b>Laptop Buying guide</b></p><br>									
												<p>A laptop is a portable and handy personal computer which has a display screen and
keyboard and is battery powered. Its size is even smaller than a briefcase and is majorly used during travelling. Selecting the right laptop suiting your requirement is a very challenging task.</p><br>
									
												<p>You should identify the purpose of buying a laptop, whether it is for business, gaming or for web browsing.</p><br>
												<ul class="marker2">										
													<li><b>Gaming Laptops :</b> ​ Gaming laptops should have high resolution display, large							
														RAM and good processing power to give user a rich gaming experience.</li>						
										
													<li><b>Business Laptops :</b> ​ For business purpose, you need rugged and easy to carry
														laptops with good features, updated Intel Core i5 processors, excellent battery
														life and lot of connectivity options. Apple Macbook Pro, Dell Latitude, Lenovo
														Thinkpad series, Toshiba Kirabook, HP Elitebook and HP Ultrabook are suitable

															<li><b>Display Screen:</b> ​ Good quality screen is always advisable for better viewing.
																Smaller screen sized laptop is very portable and easy to carry. 14 inch-16 inch
																size is very good enough for all purposes. If you have higher resolution works,
																then go for bigger sized screens like 17 inch or more.</li>									
												
															<li><b>Storage:</b>​ Go for at least 500GB to 750GB of disk space, considering the user’s
																work requirement. For gaming purposes, you should opt for high storage
																spaces like 8GB or more as games require lot of disk space.											
															</li>
											
															<li><b>Brand :</b> ​ While choosing a laptop, go for good reputed brand manufacturers like
																Lenovo, HP, Compaq, Asus, Acer, Apple, HCL, Samsung, Sony, Toshiba or Dell.							
																They provide good service and quality.</li>

												<p><b>Best Priced Mobile Phone</b></p> <br>									
												<p>With availability of so many choices of mobile phones in same budget has made it
													really difficult for the buyers to choose the right mobile phone. These options make
													selection very difficult. Buyers either get confused with the features or lucrative prices
													of different brands. Just type the term 'mobile phone in Rs.10,000 price range' and you
													will be bombarded with the numerous choices from same or different brands. The
													best technique to choose right mobile phone from the large options is to compare
													different phones for features, prices and guarantee. You should also define the									
													preferences before comparing mobile phones.</p><br>
									
									
												<p>With the technological advancements, mobile phone companies have filled the market
													with abundant models with different features. So, the mobile analysis task starts with
													the need recognition. Some people give preference to simple handsets while some like
													trendy mobile phones with advanced features like high mega pixel camera, more									
													memory, 4G net connectivity etc.</p><br>		
									
												<p><b>Major factors to check before deciding on any particular brand or model are:</b></p><br>
									
												<ul class="marker2">										
													<li><b>Operating System :</b> ​ There are three main operating platforms to choose from -
														Windows, iOS and Android. iOS operating system is developed by Apple and
														their phones are costliest of all three. iOS provides smooth operation of Apple
														phones , providing ample options of downloaded apps from itunes store.Android OS is more customizable (in 
														terms of widgets, lock screen and apps)
														and provides open source platform where even third party developers can
														create apps and tools. Though Windows phones are quite consistent than
														Android or iPhones but they are less popular as they provide minimal options in
														terms of apps and games selection.</li>										
													
													<li><b>Screen Size :</b> ​ Once you have shortlisted the type of platform, the screen size of
														a mobile is next foremost step to consider. The phones come in varied screen
														sizes ranging from 2.4 inch to 6 inches. Small screen phones (less than 4 inch)
														are very easy to hold or pocket and are mainly used for calling and messaging.
														Medium screen phones (4-5 inches) are well suited for internet browsing or
														even watching movies or videos. Phablets (having more than 5 inches screen
														size) are bulky and are difficult to carry but are suitable for 3D gaming and								
														larger readable view of videos, text, apps and websites.</li>
										
													<li><b>Type of Processor :</b> ​ Processor helps in managing the tasks efficiently, hence
														you can select a mobile phone according to the processor type- Dual core, Quad
														core or Octa core. More number of cores will lead to smooth execution of
														multiple tasks simultaneously. Also the clock speed should be greater than
														1GHz as high clock speed will lead to smooth and effortless running of apps,								
														games and videos.</li>
										
										
													<li><b>Camera :</b>​ Smartphone cameras have replaced the point-and-shoot and digital
														cameras. So while buying smartphones with good cameras, make sure it has
														autofocus and generally phones with 8MP or more have good image resolution									
														and are considered appropriate.</li>
										
													<li><b>Keypad :</b> ​ These days, most bigger sized phones have touchscreen keypads for
														comfort whereas few cheaper and old models with full Qwerty keypads are also								
														available in the market.</li>
										
													<li><b>Battery Backup :</b> ​ While purchasing a mobile, battery plays a vital role so as to
														avoid any sort of inconvenience. The battery of approximately 2500 mAH or									
														more is considered to be apt for any kind of mobile usage.</li>
										
													<li><b>Other features :</b>​ Thinner and slimmer phones are easy to handle and take less
														space in pockets and purses. Mobile phone should be fully equipped with
														advanced features like dual SIM, GPS, Bluetooth, Wifi, WiFi hotspot, HDMI,
														DLNA, NFC , 4G and good battery backup. Few high-end phones have exquisite
														features like dust-proof, water-proof, scratch resistant glass, fingerprint scanner							
														and shock proof.</li>
										
													<li><b>Price :</b>​ Choose the mobiles according to your budget and then compare their							
														specifications and features.</li>
									
												</ul><br>
												<p>Price is the most important thing you need to compare before making the final									
													purchase. Check the complete ​<b> price lists of mobile phones in India</b>​ offered at
													different stores. Daily updated price list helps you get the best deals on mobile
													phones. It also saves you time wasted on visiting different portals to get prices and							
													then comparing those.</p><br>

											<div class="panel-body">									
												<p><b>What to see when buying an Air Conditioner</b></p><br>									
												<p>In hot weather, Air-coolers are cheaper option but they add to humidity especially in
													the months of June and July when it becomes unbearable and in that case, Air									
													conditioners are the best option. While choosing right ​<b>air-conditioner price</b>​ for
													your room, there are certain things which have to be kept in mind like the size ofyour room, number of people
													occupying the room , outdoor climate, amount of light coming into the room, area of windows, number of 
													windows and on which floor your room is.</p><br>
									
												<ul class="marker2">										
													<li><b>Tonnage of Air conditioner :</b> ​ Tonnage refers to the cooling capacity of an air
														conditioner as per the size and requirement of the room. A thumb rule which is used
														internationally is that for every square foot of room, we require 20 Btu/hr (British
														Thermal Units per hour). The cooling capacity of an AC is measured in Btu/hr (British
														thermal unit/hour) which is is its ability to extract a certain amount of heat from a
														room in an hour.. The AC is considered to be more powerful when the Btu/hr value
														is higher. An oversized or high capacity air-conditioner is less effective and less
														energy efficient. For room size less than 150 sqft, 1 ton capacity of AC is sufficient. At
														Least 1.5 ton AC capacity is needed for room size having area approximately 151 –						
														250 sqft, and for Room Size 251 – 400 sqft, AC capacity needed is 2 ton or above.</li>
													
													<li><b>Compressor :</b> ​ Compressor is a very important component of AC. They are
														classified into three types- reciprocating, rotary and scroll. Reciprocating
														compressors are usually used in small to medium systems, such as car ACs, and are
														bulky and noisy. Rotary units are compact and less noisy, while scroll compressors
														are the quietest and most efficient of the three. However, the last two are more						
														expensive and are also difficult to repair.</li>
										
													<li><b>Split or Window AC- Which is better?</b>	
														<ul class="marker2">												
															<li>Window ​<b>air conditioner price</b>​ is is quite low as compared to that of a split AC				
																and is easy to install and maintain.</li>
												
															<li>Split AC makes less noise than window AC as the unit is installed outside the room.</li>
												
															<li>The regular maintenance is high in case of split AC. The gas has to be filled
																after certain time period. This is an added burden on the consumer apart from the				
																high initial split air conditioner price.</li>
												
															<li>Leakage Issue: In case of a Split AC, sometimes the water tips from the air
																unit during high humidity. This is because of the fact that the droplets are formed					
																right on the face of blower.</li>
												
															<li>Split AC is better when it comes to cooling and power efficiency.</li>								
														</ul>										
													</li>
										
													<li><b>Energy Efficiency and Star Rating:</b> ​ A unit with a higher star rating is more
														expensive than the one with fewer stars.However, it will also consume less electricity
														and cut down on power consumption while saving energy and being
														environment-friendly. In India, an AC runs for around 252 days on an average. The
														BEE rates appliances from 1 to 5 stars. A 5 star AC is the most energy efficient and
														consumes the lowest energy while conserving energy and drastically reducing your
														electricity bills.But you should consider a 5 star rated product only when the
														consumption is extremely high. Hence with the help of above mentioned points,
														buyer can make a right buying decision after choosing comparing specifications and							
														<b>air conditioner price</b>​ of various models available in the market.</li>

												<p><b>How to buy Good Audio system?</b></p><br>
												
												<p>Audio is the sound which is audible to human beings within acoustic range. Audio files
													are usually compressed in MP3 format or wav file format for faster transmission.</p><br>
									
												<p><b>There are two types of audio amplifiers which help in choosing right audio system:</b></p><br>
									
									
												<ul class="marker2">
													<li><b>Class A/B analog amplifier :</b>​ These types of amplifiers are conventional or
														traditional type of amplifiers. They consume more power and are less energy
														efficient than digital amplifiers. An analog amplifier consists of two separate
														circuits – output circuit which generates electrical power output signal for
														speakers from incoming audio signal and an AC signal which modulates the
														sound waves.</li>
										
													<li><b>Class D digital amplifier :</b>​ These are high-quality digital amplifiers which are
														used nowadays and are more energy efficient (90% or more) than analog
														amplifiers. Digital amplifiers use high frequency switching circuits to modulate
														the output devices.</li>
									
												</ul><br>
								
												<p>The sound is reproduced in multiple formats like monophonic sound, stereophonic
													sound, Dolby Digital Plus (it is a six-channel audio system and is commonly used in
													home theater systems). You should be careful while buying amplifiers as a
													low-powered amplifier can burn out the speakers whereas large amplifiers will									
													generate clean and distortion-free AC audio signals.</p><br>
									
									
												<p>For a high quality sound, we require good and reputed audio system and speakers.
													Following are the three things which will help in selecting Right Audio systems for ur house :</p><br>
									
												<ul class="marker2">										
													<li><b>Purpose to Buy :</b> ​ You should first identify the primary use of audio systems. In
														case you want to buy it with the purpose of watching movies and television,
														then opt for a surround sound system for an accurate viewing as well as										
														listening experience.</li>
										
													<li><b>Size of Room :</b> ​ The size of room also plays a vital role in deciding which audio
														system you wish to purchase. In case , your room size is big, then you must								
														select full-sized and full-range speakers to get powerful and excellent sound.</li>
									
													<li><b>Budget allocated :</b> ​ Your budget and price range also decides in selecting the
														quality of audio system. For bigger rooms, you have to buy powerful audio									
														systems, and hence have to invest in more money.</li>									
												</ul><br>
									
												<p>While buying, online purchase the products of reputed brands and manufacturers like
													Philips, Panasonic, Sony, Skullcandy, JBL, Transcend, Vox, Ambrane, iBall, Sennheiser,

												<p>Nowadays, Television has become a necessity rather than a luxury and
													buying a TV is one of the most toughest decision that anyone can take.
													The numerous options of brands and models available in the market has
													made buying a television a challenge. With advanced technology and
													constant addition of new features by Television manufacturers to
													provide better viewing experience, the consumers get confused and are										
													often lured by the offers given by various online and offline retailers."</p><br>
									
												<p>Before you pick a right TV, you need to understand the basic terminology
													associated with TV like screen size, screen types, resolution, refresh rate,
													contrast ratio etc. This TV buying guide will help you identify and
													evaluate them through simple questions and their answers so that the									
													decision making becomes easier.</p><br>									
								
												<p><b>What is the right TV size suitable for you ?</b></p><br>									
									
												<p>There is a tremendous increase in demand of larger screen televisions.
													While selecting the screen size, you should consider how far you will be
													sitting from the screen and size of the room. If you are sitting too close
													to TV, then you will see pixelated images and lot of picture noise
													whereas if you are too far from TV, then the picture details will merge
													with each other and adversely affect your viewing experience. Minimum
													viewing distance is twice your TV size whereas maximum viewing
													distance is 1.6 times of the minimum viewing distance. For example, for
													32 inch TV (81 cm), minimum viewing distance is 162cm (64”) or 5 feet
													and maximum viewing distance is 8 feet. Most of the television models									
													have 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen design).</p><br>

												<p><b>What TV technology is best - LCD, LED, Plasma or OLED ?</b></p><br>
												
												<p>The most common screen types of TV are Plasma, LCD, LED and OLED.
													Earlier the screen options were limited to Plasma and LCD but with latest
													advanced technologies, LED and OLED TVs have become more popular among the users.</p><br>
									
												<p><b>LCD TV :</b></p><br>
									
												<p>Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs use fluorescent tubes (CCFLs) to light the
													screen. They are ideal for indoor viewing and feature a relatively low
													contrast. They are less expensive as compared to other new technologies
													but are slowly been replaced with ultrathin LED-backlit LCDs models.
													They are bulkier and provide inferior picture quality as compared to that of LED Tvs.</p><br>
												
												<p><b>LED TV :</b></p><br>
												
												<p>LED TVs are similar to LCD TVs except that they use coloured LEDs (light
													emitting diodes) instead of CCFL to backlit the display. This is done in
													two ways – either by placing LEDs directly behind the screen (Back lit
													LED) or by placing LEDs along the edges of the panel (which is called
													Edge lit LED). Both the techniques use consume less energy than Plasma or LCD TVs.</p><br>

												<p><b>PLASMA TV :</b></p><br>
												
												<p>Unlike LCD displays which requires backlight, plasma TV displays use
													self-emitting small cells called plasmas which contain electrically charged
													ionized gases and light up on their own. They are superior to LCD panels
													in terms of contrast ratio, colour quality and offer wider viewing angle
													but they are only viable in case of bigger screens (50 inches or more).
													Nowadays, plasma displays are diminishing from the market as they are
													complex to manufacture as compared to other technologies and do not										
													perform well in brightly lit rooms.</p><br>
												
												<p><b>OLED TV :</b></p><br>
												
												<p>OLED TVs (Organic Light Emitting Diode) are the latest technology in
													digital display. The light emitting diodes emit their own light when an
													electric current is passed through them. They are self-luminated and do
													not need a bulky backlight making them ultra-slim and more power
													efficient than LED TVs. They offer much better contrast and widerviewing angle of 180 degrees. The only 
													drawback is that they are exorbitantly priced.</p><br>

												<p><b>What display resolution should I go for ?</b></p><br>									
												<p>Display Resolution is the number of pixels you can view in a dimension.
													It is referred to as width x height. For example : 1920X1080 pixel
													resolution. Most of the televisions offer HD Ready or Full HD resolution.
													TVs having SD resolution have become obsolete now. The resolution ofUltra HD is exactly four times higher 
													than that of full HD, hence ensuring
													much more picture detailing, with content requiring a lot more
													bandwidth and storage space. If you sit closer to TV, then you should opt
													for higher resolution Ultra HD TV over a 1080p TV to view every minute
													detail. 4K TVs are used in digital cinemas as they offer resolution of
													4096x2160 and there are currently very few options for watching native
													4K content. It is always better to opt for full HD resolution for better picture clarity.</p><br>

												<p><b>Refresh Rate :</b></p><br>			
								
												<p>The video you see on TV is the series of many still images in rapid
													succession. The images occur so fast that they give an illusion of motion.
													The speed at which the images are displayed on screen per second isreferred to as Refresh Rate. It is 
													expressed in Hertz (Hz). A faster refresh rate ensures speedy motion, ideal for sporting events, action
													movies and playing video games. Higher refresh rate reduces the time between the
													display of frames hence leading to improved and blur-free picture
													quality. Plasma Tvs have refresh rate of 600Hz whereas basic LCD TV has									
													60Hz refresh rate.</p><br>
									
									
												<p><b>What is a 3D TV?</b></p><br>			
								
												<p>3D is an add-on feature in mostly high-end television models to provide
													live experience to the users and make them feel as if they are in the
													middle of the action. These Tvs display 3D videos and require special 3D
													glasses for viewing. They come in two different technologies - Active and										
													Passive.</p><br>									
									
												<p><b>Active 3D :</b></p><br>									
											
												<p>Active 3D glasses work by quickly alternating the images between both
													right and left eyes. They offer full size 1080p images at a greater depth
													but can be very tiresome if used for long hours. They are more expensive										
													and require battery to operate.</p><br>	
								
												<p><b>Passive 3D :</b></p><br>			
									
												<p>Passive 3D glasses show different images simultaneously but each eye
													can view only one of the images. They provide slightly inferior picturequality at 720p but are cheaper and 
													do not require a battery. These are	mostly used in movie theaters to watch 3D movies.</p><br>
									
									
												<p><b>What is a Smart TV?</b></p><br>									
									
												<p>Smart TV feature enables you to connect your internet connection with
													your TV. You can also connect your Smart TV with your laptop/phone and
													operate via various advanced technologies like miracast or DLNA. The
													user can access web, watch online videos, live events, manage social
													networking profiles like Twitter, Facebook, Youtube etc and much more
													on TV. Few Smart TVs are equipped with camera for various functions										
													like Skype calls and message clients.</p><br>
									
												<p>Shoppers should make a wise purchase by evaluating the TV features
													and then narrow down the choices depending upon their budget, type of
													content they wish to watch, room size and their requirement. Most
													popular brands of TV are SONY, PANASONIC, LG, SAMSUNG, PANASONIC									
													and PHILIPS.</p><br>

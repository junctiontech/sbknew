									<b>	How to Book the Cheapest Flight Possible to Anywhere</b>								
								</a>							
							</h4>

								<p>We’ve all experienced the tiresome, repeated searching when trying to book the cheapest possible flights to any given destination. With endless search engines and continually fluctuating prices, the approach to frugal flight booking is overwhelming. Here’s some key tips that will save you time, frustration and most importantly money when booking your next flight.</p><br>								
								<p> <b>1. Keep your searches top secret</b></p><br>							
								<p>You’re not crazy for thinking that a flight price has changed after searching it a few times in your web browser. Based on the cookies in your browser, flight prices do increase when a particular route is repeatedly searched, as the site wants to scare you into booking the flight quickly before prices get even higher. Always search for flights in incognito or private browsing mode to see the lowest prices.</p><br>								
								<p>In Google Chrome or Safari, incognito is enabled by hitting Command (or “Control” if using PC), Shift, “N”. For Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer, hit Command (or “Control” if using a PC), Shift, “P”. This will open a new browser window where your information is not tracked, thus not inflating prices as you search. Note: if you’re using an older version of OS X, open Safari then click “Safari” in the menu bar, and select “Private Browsing”.</p><br>								
								<p>Your cookies are reset each time you re-open an incognito window. So if you want to start with a clean slate for each flight search (so your previous searches aren’t “remembered”, potentially inflating costs), close all your incognito windows, open a new one, and then perform your flight search.</p><br>								
								<p><b>2. Use the best flight search engines</b></p><br>							
								<p>All search engines have inflated flight costs as part of taking a cut from the airlines. Some search engines consistently inflate much higher than others. It pays to familiarise yourself with sites that offer the best prices.</p><br>
								<p><b>3. Identify the cheapest day to fly out</b></p><br>
								<p>While many theories exist around booking specifically on a Tuesday to save money, the reality is there is no consistent truth to exactly which days are cheapest to fly. Most of the time it is cheaper to leave on a weekday, though this isn't always the case. Your best strategy is to get a quick visual of prices for a whole month to see what days are cheapest for your specific route.</p><br>
								<p>Here’s how:</p><br>
								<p>Step 1. Hop on Searchb4kharch<br>
									Step 2. Enter your departure & arrival cities<br>
									Step 3. Select “one-way” (even if flying round trip – you’re just determining the cheapest days to fly out first)<br>
									Step 4. Click “Depart” but instead of entering a date, select “Whole Month” so you can see which date is cheapest<br>
									Step 5. Hit “search” and see which date is cheapest. Sometimes not all dates have a price listed, as indicated by the magnifying glasses. If you want to see a price that isn't shown, simply click on the magnifying glass over the date.</p><br>
								<p><b>4. If you know when and where you’re going, don’t wait to book</b></p>
								<p>Rarely ever do airline tickets get cheaper as your departure date approaches, especially if you need to fly on a certain date. Budget airlines typically offer low rates as a baseline price, and as these tickets sell, the remaining ones increase in cost. This is very typical in Europe and Australia. If you know when and where you’re going, don’t wait on an unknown sale. More often than not, your biggest savings come from booking far ahead when you can.</p><br>
								<p><b>5. Check if it’s cheaper to pay in other currencies</b></p>
								<p>Before booking a flight, consider if the rate is cheaper if paid in another currency. An important note when doing this: make sure you’re using a credit card that is free of foreign-transaction fees.</p>

									<b>How to Save Money on Hotels</b>	
								</a>	
							</h4>	
						</div>

								<ul class="marker">    
									<li>Start your hotel search as early as you can. The longer stretch of time you have to search the better deal you’ll likely find. Hotel rates almost never go down for holiday destinations and resorts.</li>	
									<li>   Booking early isn't only about great deals. Early bookers get the best rooms.</li>  
									<li>  If your dates can be flexible then compare different date ranges for the best rates. Hotels can fill up for a big convention or big event. Busy and expensive one weekend. Empty and cheap the next.</li>  
									<li> Flip-flop weekends and weekdays. Hotels target different types of travellers which will have very different weekday and weekend routines. Hotels that have a large business clientèle can be very quiet (with large discounts) on weekends. Hotels that see more leisure tourists will be packed on weekends but cheaper on weekdays.</li>
									<li>  Think upgrade: book the least expensive room through a booking website then contact the hotel directly to inform them of special requirements or enquire about any available upgrades – if the hotel is quiet they’ll often be free or for a nominal charge.</li>							
								</ul>								
								<p><b>When is the Best Time to Book Hotels?</b></p>
								<p>Here’s a huge generalization that works pretty well for most situations: For hotels that have a business clientèle last minute booking can offer good deals. For hotels, resorts, and vacation rentals that have tourists as their primary guests then booking 3 months to 6 months prior to your stay is likely the best.</p><br>
								<p>Why? Business travellers are much more likely to arrange and make last-minute (or last week) travel plans. A month before a given date, a hotel in the financial district of London might not have many bookings but will not start discounting those rooms yet. It will still expect to make a lot of bookings in the week or two before that time frame.</p><br>
								<p>Often it’s not just about the price. Early booking will get you the best rooms at a similar price to the less coveted rooms. E.g. A huge family room that is only a little more than a cramped double room.</p><br>
								<p><b>What Day of the Week Has the Best Hotel Deals?</b></p>
								<p>It depends what type of hotel you’re booking.</p><br>
								<p>Business hotels will offer bigger discounts on the weekends (when business clients are at home). Budget hotels will have empty rooms (and discounts) through the week because the people that stay there (weekend shoppers, concert goers, university students) come on there weekends and return home Sunday night.</p><br>
								<p>A final tip, is to check whether breakfast is included. When you arrive at the hotel you can even ask (with a tone of voice that expects that it is included). It’s often of little cost to the hotel to serve another buffet breakfast but this can be a huge savings for you especially over the course of a week or extended stay.</p><br>

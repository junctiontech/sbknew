									<b>	How to Book the Cheapest Flight Possible to Anywhere</b>								
								</a>							
							</h4>							
						</div>						
						<div id="collapseOne-2" class="panel-collapse collapse">							
							<div class="panel-body">								
								<p>We’ve all experienced the tiresome, repeated searching when trying to book the cheapest possible flights to any given destination. With endless search engines and continually fluctuating prices, the approach to frugal flight booking is overwhelming. Here’s some key tips that will save you time, frustration and most importantly money when booking your next flight.</p><br>								
								<p> <b>1. Keep your searches top secret</b></p><br>							
								<p>You’re not crazy for thinking that a flight price has changed after searching it a few times in your web browser. Based on the cookies in your browser, flight prices do increase when a particular route is repeatedly searched, as the site wants to scare you into booking the flight quickly before prices get even higher. Always search for flights in incognito or private browsing mode to see the lowest prices.</p><br>								
								<p>In Google Chrome or Safari, incognito is enabled by hitting Command (or “Control” if using PC), Shift, “N”. For Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer, hit Command (or “Control” if using a PC), Shift, “P”. This will open a new browser window where your information is not tracked, thus not inflating prices as you search. Note: if you’re using an older version of OS X, open Safari then click “Safari” in the menu bar, and select “Private Browsing”.</p><br>								
								<p>Your cookies are reset each time you re-open an incognito window. So if you want to start with a clean slate for each flight search (so your previous searches aren’t “remembered”, potentially inflating costs), close all your incognito windows, open a new one, and then perform your flight search.</p><br>								
								<p><b>2. Use the best flight search engines</b></p><br>							
								<p>All search engines have inflated flight costs as part of taking a cut from the airlines. Some search engines consistently inflate much higher than others. It pays to familiarise yourself with sites that offer the best prices.</p><br>
								<p><b>3. Identify the cheapest day to fly out</b></p><br>
								<p>While many theories exist around booking specifically on a Tuesday to save money, the reality is there is no consistent truth to exactly which days are cheapest to fly. Most of the time it is cheaper to leave on a weekday, though this isn't always the case. Your best strategy is to get a quick visual of prices for a whole month to see what days are cheapest for your specific route.</p><br>
								<p>Here’s how:</p><br>
								<p>Step 1. Hop on Searchb4kharch<br>
									Step 2. Enter your departure & arrival cities<br>
									Step 3. Select “one-way” (even if flying round trip – you’re just determining the cheapest days to fly out first)<br>
									Step 4. Click “Depart” but instead of entering a date, select “Whole Month” so you can see which date is cheapest<br>
									Step 5. Hit “search” and see which date is cheapest. Sometimes not all dates have a price listed, as indicated by the magnifying glasses. If you want to see a price that isn't shown, simply click on the magnifying glass over the date.</p><br>
								<p><b>4. If you know when and where you’re going, don’t wait to book</b></p>
								<p>Rarely ever do airline tickets get cheaper as your departure date approaches, especially if you need to fly on a certain date. Budget airlines typically offer low rates as a baseline price, and as these tickets sell, the remaining ones increase in cost. This is very typical in Europe and Australia. If you know when and where you’re going, don’t wait on an unknown sale. More often than not, your biggest savings come from booking far ahead when you can.</p><br>
								<p><b>5. Check if it’s cheaper to pay in other currencies</b></p>
								<p>Before booking a flight, consider if the rate is cheaper if paid in another currency. An important note when doing this: make sure you’re using a credit card that is free of foreign-transaction fees.</p>

									<b>How to Save Money on Hotels</b>

							</h4>	
						</div>	
						<div id="collapseTwo-2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
							<div class="panel-body">
								<ul class="marker">    
									<li>Start your hotel search as early as you can. The longer stretch of time you have to search the better deal you’ll likely find. Hotel rates almost never go down for holiday destinations and resorts.</li>	
									<li>   Booking early isn't only about great deals. Early bookers get the best rooms.</li>  
									<li>  If your dates can be flexible then compare different date ranges for the best rates. Hotels can fill up for a big convention or big event. Busy and expensive one weekend. Empty and cheap the next.</li>  
									<li> Flip-flop weekends and weekdays. Hotels target different types of travellers which will have very different weekday and weekend routines. Hotels that have a large business clientèle can be very quiet (with large discounts) on weekends. Hotels that see more leisure tourists will be packed on weekends but cheaper on weekdays.</li>
									<li>  Think upgrade: book the least expensive room through a booking website then contact the hotel directly to inform them of special requirements or enquire about any available upgrades – if the hotel is quiet they’ll often be free or for a nominal charge.</li>							
								</ul>								
								<p><b>When is the Best Time to Book Hotels?</b></p>
								<p>Here’s a huge generalization that works pretty well for most situations: For hotels that have a business clientèle last minute booking can offer good deals. For hotels, resorts, and vacation rentals that have tourists as their primary guests then booking 3 months to 6 months prior to your stay is likely the best.</p><br>
								<p>Why? Business travellers are much more likely to arrange and make last-minute (or last week) travel plans. A month before a given date, a hotel in the financial district of London might not have many bookings but will not start discounting those rooms yet. It will still expect to make a lot of bookings in the week or two before that time frame.</p><br>
								<p>Often it’s not just about the price. Early booking will get you the best rooms at a similar price to the less coveted rooms. E.g. A huge family room that is only a little more than a cramped double room.</p><br>
								<p><b>What Day of the Week Has the Best Hotel Deals?</b></p>
								<p>It depends what type of hotel you’re booking.</p><br>
								<p>Business hotels will offer bigger discounts on the weekends (when business clients are at home). Budget hotels will have empty rooms (and discounts) through the week because the people that stay there (weekend shoppers, concert goers, university students) come on there weekends and return home Sunday night.</p><br>
								<p>A final tip, is to check whether breakfast is included. When you arrive at the hotel you can even ask (with a tone of voice that expects that it is included). It’s often of little cost to the hotel to serve another buffet breakfast but this can be a huge savings for you especially over the course of a week or extended stay.</p><br>

									<p><b>A tablet for all..</b></p>
									
									<p>Finding a tablet is never a easy task when there are so many options available in the
market. A tablet is a portable computer that operates from a touchscreen or with a
stylus. Some tablets even have a keyboard which makes it even more comfortable to
use. They are normally smaller and lighter in weight than an average laptop. They are
very helpful during travelling as they are very handy and convenient to use. Just like
laptops and mobiles, tablets also comes with Windows browser and pre-installed
applications. Tablets also have in-built battery having battery life of average 10-13
hours or more , depending on its version. All new models have Wi-fi, GPS connectivity
and webcam attached to it. Lot of great models of various reputed manufacturers are
available in the market but it is difficult to choose.</p><br>
									
									
									<p>Following are the points which will help you in deciding which tablet to buy:</p><br>
									
									<ul class="marker2">
										
										<li>Operating System : Most important factor in buying a tablet depends on the
operating system you want to go for. Tablets operability is determined by its
operating system. There are three types of operating system- Apple iOS,Android OS and Windows 8 operating system. Apple iPads are very easy-to-use
tablets with smooth experience but are costlier than other tablets. Nowadays,
iPad mini is also available which is cheaper option. Android OS tablets are easy
to use and they are free, hence lot of options are available from branded as well
Chinese manufacturers. The latest Android operating system being used these
days is version 5, also called Lollipop. But some Android models are using
										earlier versions like 4.2.</li>
										
										<li>Size of Tablet: Tablet comes in various screen sizes. Usually the screen size
varies from 6 to 12 inches diagonally across the screen. The small sized tablets
have screen size of 6 to 8 inches and are usually cheaper and require less
power than larger tablets. If you are looking for light-weight, portable tablet
which can fit easily in purse or small handbag, then probably 6-7 inches tablet is
best suited. iPad has 8 inch screen. Medium sized tablets (with size 8.9 to 10.1
inches) have better screen resolution and larger screens than 7-inch tablets.
They are best suited for watching movies and doing office work. Very few
tablets have screen size more than 10.1 inch (they are also called hybrids) and
serve the purpose somewhere between tablet and PC.										
										</li>
										<li>Storage : Tablets require storage space for all purposes, whether it is for storing
games, movies or any text document. Minimum storage space available is 8 GB.
As and when storage capacity increses, price also increases . Additional microSD
slot is available in almost all tablets except in iPad and can be expanded further
as well.	
										</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p>If you want to work on the tablet, then opt for Windows8 tablet as it is more
user-friendly. For typing and watching movies, choose lighter and portable small-sizedtablets. We have vast collection of tablets of all popular and reputed brands like Acer,
Sony, Dell, Apple, Lenovo, HP, HCl, Samsung, Toshiba, Asus, Micromax, Karbonn, to
										name a few.</p>

									<p><b>Best Priced Mobile Phone</b></p> <br>
									<p>With availability of so many choices of mobile phones in same budget has made it
really difficult for the buyers to choose the right mobile phone. These options make
selection very difficult. Buyers either get confused with the features or lucrative prices
of different brands. Just type the term 'mobile phone in Rs.10,000 price range' and you
will be bombarded with the numerous choices from same or different brands. The
best technique to choose right mobile phone from the large options is to compare
different phones for features, prices and guarantee. You should also define the
										preferences before comparing mobile phones.</p><br>
									
									<p>With the technological advancements, mobile phone companies have filled the market
with abundant models with different features. So, the mobile analysis task starts with
the need recognition. Some people give preference to simple handsets while some like
trendy mobile phones with advanced features like high mega pixel camera, more
										memory, 4G net connectivity etc.</p><br>
									
									<p><b>Major factors to check before deciding on any particular brand or model are:</b></p><br>
									<ul class="marker2">
										<li><b>Operating System :</b> ​ There are three main operating platforms to choose from -
Windows, iOS and Android. iOS operating system is developed by Apple and
their phones are costliest of all three. iOS provides smooth operation of Apple
phones , providing ample options of downloaded apps from itunes store.Android OS is more customizable (in terms of widgets, lock screen and apps)
and provides open source platform where even third party developers can
create apps and tools. Though Windows phones are quite consistent than
Android or iPhones but they are less popular as they provide minimal options in
terms of apps and games selection.</li>
										<li><b>Screen Size :</b> ​ Once you have shortlisted the type of platform, the screen size of
a mobile is next foremost step to consider. The phones come in varied screen
sizes ranging from 2.4 inch to 6 inches. Small screen phones (less than 4 inch)
are very easy to hold or pocket and are mainly used for calling and messaging.
Medium screen phones (4-5 inches) are well suited for internet browsing or
even watching movies or videos. Phablets (having more than 5 inches screen
size) are bulky and are difficult to carry but are suitable for 3D gaming and
											larger readable view of videos, text, apps and websites.</li>
										<li><b>Type of Processor :</b> ​ Processor helps in managing the tasks efficiently, hence
you can select a mobile phone according to the processor type- Dual core, Quad
core or Octa core. More number of cores will lead to smooth execution of
multiple tasks simultaneously. Also the clock speed should be greater than
1GHz as high clock speed will lead to smooth and effortless running of apps,
											games and videos.</li>
										
										<li><b>Camera :</b>​ Smartphone cameras have replaced the point-and-shoot and digital
cameras. So while buying smartphones with good cameras, make sure it has
autofocus and generally phones with 8MP or more have good image resolution
											and are considered appropriate.</li>
										<li><b>Keypad :</b> ​ These days, most bigger sized phones have touchscreen keypads for
comfort whereas few cheaper and old models with full Qwerty keypads are also
											available in the market.</li>
										<li><b>Battery Backup :</b> ​ While purchasing a mobile, battery plays a vital role so as to
avoid any sort of inconvenience. The battery of approximately 2500 mAH or
											more is considered to be apt for any kind of mobile usage.</li>
										<li><b>Other features :</b>​ Thinner and slimmer phones are easy to handle and take less
space in pockets and purses. Mobile phone should be fully equipped with
advanced features like dual SIM, GPS, Bluetooth, Wifi, WiFi hotspot, HDMI,
DLNA, NFC , 4G and good battery backup. Few high-end phones have exquisite
features like dust-proof, water-proof, scratch resistant glass, fingerprint scanner
											and shock proof.</li>
										<li><b>Price :</b>​ Choose the mobiles according to your budget and then compare their
											specifications and features.</li>
									</ul><br>
									
									<p>Price is the most important thing you need to compare before making the final
										purchase. Check the complete ​<b> price lists of mobile phones in India</b>​ offered at
different stores. Daily updated price list helps you get the best deals on mobile
phones. It also saves you time wasted on visiting different portals to get prices and
										then comparing those.</p>

								<div class="panel-body">
									<p><b>What to see when buying an Air Conditioner</b></p><br>
									<p>In hot weather, Air-coolers are cheaper option but they add to humidity especially in
the months of June and July when it becomes unbearable and in that case, Air
										conditioners are the best option. While choosing right ​<b>air-conditioner price</b>​ for
your room, there are certain things which have to be kept in mind like the size ofyour room, number of people occupying the room , outdoor climate, amount of light
coming into the room, area of windows, number of windows and on which floor
										your room is.</p><br>
									<ul class="marker2">
										<li><b>Tonnage of Air conditioner :</b> ​ Tonnage refers to the cooling capacity of an air
conditioner as per the size and requirement of the room. A thumb rule which is used
internationally is that for every square foot of room, we require 20 Btu/hr (British
Thermal Units per hour). The cooling capacity of an AC is measured in Btu/hr (British
thermal unit/hour) which is is its ability to extract a certain amount of heat from a
room in an hour.. The AC is considered to be more powerful when the Btu/hr value
is higher. An oversized or high capacity air-conditioner is less effective and less
energy efficient. For room size less than 150 sqft, 1 ton capacity of AC is sufficient. At
Least 1.5 ton AC capacity is needed for room size having area approximately 151 –
											250 sqft, and for Room Size 251 – 400 sqft, AC capacity needed is 2 ton or above.</li>
										<li><b>Compressor :</b> ​ Compressor is a very important component of AC. They are
classified into three types- reciprocating, rotary and scroll. Reciprocating
compressors are usually used in small to medium systems, such as car ACs, and are
bulky and noisy. Rotary units are compact and less noisy, while scroll compressors
are the quietest and most efficient of the three. However, the last two are more
											expensive and are also difficult to repair.</li>
										<li><b>Split or Window AC- Which is better?</b>
											
											<ul class="marker2">
												<li>Window ​<b>air conditioner price</b>​ is is quite low as compared to that of a split AC
													and is easy to install and maintain.</li>
												<li>Split AC makes less noise than window AC as the unit is installed outside the
													room.</li>
												<li>The regular maintenance is high in case of split AC. The gas has to be filled
after certain time period. This is an added burden on the consumer apart from the
													high initial split air conditioner price.</li>
												<li>Leakage Issue: In case of a Split AC, sometimes the water tips from the air
unit during high humidity. This is because of the fact that the droplets are formed
													right on the face of blower.</li>
												<li>Split AC is better when it comes to cooling and power efficiency.<li>
